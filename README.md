# Auxilia

**Aim:** Providing an easy-to-use donation platform to source funds and commodities for the needy, eliminating the middleman commission and deceit.

**Objective:** Charity is an act of kindness, where a person who has financially more than enough of what he or she needs contributes apart of his or her surplus income for the fulfillment of the needs of those who are less capable. The idea of the project “AUXILIA: A helping hand for the needy” is to connect people through a platform where each user can donate to a cause and where each user can convey their needs and problems. The network would maintain a database of donors and recipients to keep track of the donations being made and the donations being received. The platform would assist many people in their daily lives and would help many people spread happiness and do well.This platform helps solve the above problems by creating an online portal where users can become a donor or a recipient and ensure end-to-end encryption by using globally used payment gateways.

**Scope:** As human beings, we try to help each other while facing problems in our own life. So,to reduce the hassle of donating and providing a smile on both the donor and recipient’s face we propose our system AUXILIA. AUXILIA would provide a single platform where users can donate whatever they want to whomever they want to with full transparency. This will help elderly people, children, NGOs, people suffering from disease, etc., and will do a lot of good when it is brought into real-time. The deliverables of the project would be:
1. Creating an end-to-end platform for people's donation needs
2. Interface for both - Donor and Receiver.
3. Easy to use and easy to understand the functionality.
4. Multiple-use case personas
5. Connect donors with the needy, and provide them a platform to help out according to their choice.
6. Safe platform with proper documentation and transparency.
7. No mandatory commission percentage which our platform will charge compared to other similar service providers. 

**Admin Login feature:** an admin login feature will embedded to keep the documentation and usage in check, the people with the admin login will ensure that safety is being maintained.
